            <p>Institutions play an important role in the economic development of a state.  The Mission needs support from two institutions namely, Fish Farmer Development Agency (FFDA) and Meghalaya State Fishery Co-operative Federation and the civil society organizations. The former is the executing agency and the latter is the people’s institution for galvanizing the farmers in marketing of inputs and output.</p>
            <h3>Fish Farmers’ Development Agency (FFDA)</h3>
            <p>
                The Fish Farmers’ Development Agency is an autonomous body created for the implementation of the Mission. The Minister (i/c. Fisheries) is the Chairman of the Agency. It will have a two-tier system of organisational structure, one at the State level and other at the district level. The Director, Fisheries is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at the State level.

                At the District level, the Superintendent of Fisheries will function as the District Executive Officers (DEO) of the FFDA, who will be responsible for the implementation of the programmes of the Mission. Two levels of contractual employees will assist the DEO in addition to the Fishery Department’s officers viz., the Sub-divisional Fishery Officers, Fishery Demonstrators, etc. The Programme Managers (PM), recruited on a contract basis from B.F.Sc/B.Sc. (Pisciculture) graduates will assist the DEOs in implementing and monitoring the State Aquaculture Mission. The second cadre is the Multiple Service Providers (MSP). They will be selected from candidates with Class XII qualification. They will be used for reaching out to the farmers. They will be imparted the necessary training by the FFDA. There will be six MSPs per district and hence, a total number of 42 MSPs will be recruited in the State during the period of the Mission. Their appointments are purely contractual and co terminus with the Mission.

            <h3>Meghalaya State Fishery Co-operative Federation</h3>
            <p>The major focus of the mission is on the poor who cannot procure the necessary inputs and sell the output on their own. If the farmers get together and form a society, they can conduct the business enterprise more efficiently. Many of the interventions of the Mission can be implemented through the co-operatives. The activities that can be entrusted to the co-operatives are: (a) Creation of co-operative fish ponds (b) supply of portable FRP hatcheries (c) management of fish feed mills (d) marketing processing of fish (e) capacity building of the farmers.</p>
            <p>There are a large number of fishery co-operatives which are in a dormant stage due to lack of activities. Since the Mission is introducing area expansion on a large scale along with infrastructure development, technology induction and capacity building of the fish farmers, some of these activities can be entrusted to the co-operative sector and it becomes viable and vibrant. In order to strengthen the cooperatives the functional support will be provided, not the general purpose support. Societies with negative network (cumulative lossess exceeding its own fund) will not be eligible for such assistance. For availing assistance for pond construction, the society must have a minimum lease period of ten years. For cooperatives with good track record assistance would provided for (a) creation of cooperative fish ponds (b) supply of portable FRP hatcheries(c) fish processing (d) technology induction (e) capacity building.</p>
